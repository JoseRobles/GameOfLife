# Game of Life API Documentation
Welcome to the Game of Life API! This API allows users to interact with Conway's Game of Life by uploading board states, retrieving future states, and exploring the board's progression.

## Endpoints
### 1. Upload a New Board State
Uploads a new board state and returns the ID of the board for further operations.

URL: POST /Process/Board

Request Body:

json

{
    "coordinates": [
        { "x": 1, "y": 2 },
        { "x": 2, "y": 2 },
        { "x": 3, "y": 2 }
    ]
}
coordinates: List of live cell coordinates for the initial board state.
Response:

Returns the id of the created board.

### 2. Get the Next State for a Board
Retrieves the next state of the board based on the Game of Life rules.

URL: GET /Process/State/Next/{boardId}

Path Parameters:

boardId (integer): The ID of the board.
Response:

[
    { "x": 2, "y": 1 },
    { "x": 2, "y": 2 },
    { "x": 2, "y": 3 }
]
Returns a list of coordinates representing the next state of the board.

### 3. Get X States Away for a Board
Retrieves the board's state after a specified number of iterations.

URL: GET /Process/State/{boardId}/Steps/{steps}

Path Parameters:

boardId (integer): The ID of the board.
steps (integer): The number of iterations to calculate.
Response:

[
    { "x": 3, "y": 2 },
    { "x": 4, "y": 2 },
    { "x": 5, "y": 2 }
]

Returns a list of coordinates representing the board's state after the specified number of steps.

### 4. Get the Final State for a Board
Retrieves the final state of the board. If the board doesn't reach a conclusion after a set number of steps, an error is returned.

URL: GET /Process/State/{boardId}/Final

Path Parameters:

boardId (integer): The ID of the board.
Response:

Success:
[
    { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
    { "x": 1, "y": 1 }
]

Returns the coordinates of the final board state.
Error:
{
    "error": "Unable to determine final state after 100 steps."
}

Returns an error message if the board fails to reach a stable or empty state after the configured number of steps.
Models
CreateBoardRequest
Represents the structure of the request body for creating a new board.

{
    "coordinates": [
        { "x": 1, "y": 2 },
        { "x": 2, "y": 2 },
        { "x": 3, "y": 2 }
    ]
}
coordinates: An array of objects representing live cell positions on the initial board.
Coordinate
Represents a cell's position on the board.

{
    "x": 1,
    "y": 2
}

x: The x-coordinate of the cell.
y: The y-coordinate of the cell.
Configuration
The number of default steps for the Final State endpoint is determined by the DefaultStepsConfig in the application settings. If the board cannot reach a final state within this limit, an error will be returned.

Notes
All responses are in JSON format.
Ensure boardId is valid for all endpoints to avoid errors.
Coordinate values are zero-based.
